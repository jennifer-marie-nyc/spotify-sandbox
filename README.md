This repo is a long-term sandbox where I practice music analytics in Excel, Python, Tableau, and APIs. I’m building fluency through small, iterative steps — charts, notes, and exploratory work. This is a sketchbook, not a polished portfolio.

### Excel report

- `excel/spotify_listening_report_2025.xlsx` – aggregated, paste-values 2025 report
  generated from the private Extended History model (no raw per-play data).
- For details on the modeling and business rules, see `docs/2025_data_notes.md`.
